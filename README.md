# Weather App üèµÔ∏è

This Weather Payment Application is a robust and user-friendly Kotlin-based mobile application
designed to facilitate seamless payment processing for weather guessing transactions through Pax
terminals.

The application integrates directly with Pax payment terminals, allowing for secure and efficient
handling of credit and debit card payments, even though no real banks are involved!
Users can easily initiate, process, and manage weather transactions with an intuitive interface 
that ensures a smooth checkout experience.

The Weather Payment Application also features real-time transaction tracking, detailed
receipts, and comprehensive sales reports, making it an essential tool for streamlining the payment
operations of any weather shop.

In order for a transaction to succeed, one needs to predict exactly the current temperature in Celcious 
with 2 decimal persision! Good luck!

similar cases elsewhere in the codebase.
